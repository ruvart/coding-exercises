# Programming exercises

In this repo I'm gonna put some programming exercises, just for fun or to kill some time.

The programming languages that I'm gonna use are:

- PHP
- JS
- Java
- Python
- Ruby
- Swift
- C#
- C++
- Clojure
- Julia
- Nim
- Dart

I'm not gonna use all the languages in all the exercises and I'm not gonna be using all the languages at the same time. After all this is just for fun and practice.

- Pascal
- C++
- Java
